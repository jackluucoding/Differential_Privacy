# Applying Differential Privacy with SEM: A Python Demo

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the integration of Differential Privacy (DP) with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). It showcases how to balance privacy and utility by adding Laplace noise to survey data.

## Prerequisites
- Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `semopy`, `diffprivlib`
```bash
pip install pandas numpy semopy diffprivlib
